This repository will be updated with any python practice I'm doing.

## ArmStrong Number
Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers. I have written a program that the user will need to input a interger into. The program then looks at the input given  and calculates and outputs whether the input is infact a armstrong number or not.

## Guessing Game
The guessing game is a program that I wrote which allows the player to choose a number out of the given range (by default the range is 1-20000 but this can be altered by changing the code). Once a player picks a number, the game will then go ahead and guess a number it thinks the player has choosen. Then the player will have to choose between three inputs. These inputs are h (higher), l (lower) and = (same number). If "h" is selected, then the program takes another go at guessing the number but this time higher than the number it previously guessed. If "l" is choosen, then it proceedes to guess a number lower than its previous guess. This is repeated until the correct number is guessed where the player would input the "=" sign.

## Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
This program takes in a user input of a list of intergers seperated by commas which it will then process to check if the list is infact a Palindrome. If yes, the user will be given a output stating that the input is a palindrom and vice versa if it is not.
